# How to programmatically navigate to the adjacent dates in the Flutter Calendar?

This example demonstrates how to programmatically navigate to the adjacent dates in the Flutter Calendar.

In the Flutter Event Calendar, you can programmatically navigate to the adjacent dates by using the [forward](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/CalendarController/forward.html) and [backward](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/CalendarController/backward.html) method of CalendarController.

If the current view has the minimum date range, the backward will not move to the previous view.If the current view has the maximum date range, the forward will not move to the next view.
